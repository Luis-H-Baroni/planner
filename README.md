# Planner
This project was developed at Rocketseat's 2024 NLW Journey Java Trail. 
The application is a backend for a trip planner capable of creating and confirming trips, adding and confirming participants, and creating activities and useful links.

## Technologies
Developed using Java and its robust framework Spring Boot.

It uses Lombok to reduce boilerplate code and JPA to manage data persistence.

Planner also uses Flyway to provide migrations for our H2 SQL database.
